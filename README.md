The business potential of big data is leading to a data-driven economy, where low-cost and low-latency data analysis
represents a major competitive advantage. The research community has proposed many technological solutions for big data, such as NoSQL databases, many of which are difficult to evaluate via standard IT procurement procedures. Lack of competences in big data domains make procurement of big data approaches a tedious and uncertain process, which might impair the success of a business.
In this paper, we address this issue by presenting a score-based benchmark for NoSQL databases, which support adopter in selecting a solution that fits their needs. The proposed benchmark is independent from the deployment platform, requires low effort on the part of end users, is extensible and can be also applied to SQL databases, can be used to evaluate databases according to different properties (e.g., performance, consistency), and can be integrated with existing benchmarks to reduce the burden of their execution. We experimentally evaluate our methodology to validate its effectiveness.

## Experimental Settings

### Environment 1
The **experimental environment 1** consists of a physical machine Dell PowerEdge 6850 equipped with 4 Intel Xeon Quad Core 2.6 GHz, 16GB ECC RAM, 6x 146 GB Serial Attached SCSI 10K RPM, and 2x 1Gb/s Ethernet NIC. The physical machine hosts XenServer 6.2 deploying different virtual machines over which the databases target of our evaluation have been installed.
